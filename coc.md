# Code of Conduct

Below, you’ll find the Code of Conduct for Dev209 at MJC --
If you are a student of Modesto Junior College, note that you are bound by all enforcement of the Institutions rules of conduct outlined [here](https://www.yosemite.edu/trustees/board_policy/5500%20Standards%20of%20Student%20Conduct.pdf).
Your participation in the Dev209 community will be an explicit choice, and so this code intends to be explicit on behavior this community can not tolerate.
## Conduct

* No harassment.
* No questioning or challenging someone’s stated self-identity or chosen labels, even if they conflict with your own views.
* No incitement of violence towards any individual, including encouraging a person to commit suicide or to engage in self-harm.
* No deliberate “outing” of any aspect of a person’s identity without their consent except as necessary to protect vulnerable people from intentional abuse.

* No unwelcome comments regarding a person’s lifestyle choices and practices, including those related to food, health, parenting, relationships, drugs, and employment.
* No offensive comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, mental illness, neuro(a)typicality, physical appearance, body size, age, race, national origin, ethnic origin, nationality, immigration status, language, religion or lack thereof, or other identity marker.
* No debating the rights and lived experiences of marginalized people in the community.
* **If someone comes to you to explain How something you did or said, hurt or offended them, unless specifically asked to explain your intention, the appropriate response is "Sorry".**
* "Sorry" is not an admission of guilt, it is the simple recognition of someone else's feelings.


**Harassment includes:**

* Deliberate misgendering or use of “dead” or rejected names

* Physical contact and simulated physical contact without consent or after a request to stop
* Threats of violence
* Deliberate intimidation
* Stalking or following
* Unwanted photography or recording, including logging online activity for harassment purposes
* Unwelcome sexual attention
* Continued one-on-one communication after requests to cease

## Scope

This code covers members activity starting on the agreement, and participation in community, and ends when member ends association and participation in the Community.

This is meant to only effect community participation when violation is between two or more members, barring special circumstances that can only be addressed as they come up.

**Notice this Scope covers a Time Domain, and not the Location or Medium where a violation occurs**



## Reporting
If a violation of this code is made apparent to you or a direct dispute occurs between yourself and another member you have a few options in resolving the matter.
1. Report the infraction to a trusted member of the Community who can help moderate the situation.

2. If you feel the severity of the situation causes you to fear for your safety **stop** immediately and consider contacting Campus Safety, as such a violation likely violates their policies. Contact information located [here](https://www.mjc.edu/general/safety/)



 Modesto Junior College, and the Yosemite Community College District, should not be viewed as having endorsed this document.
## Consequences
Violation of most of these guidelines, alone constitute a report directly to campus or local authorities. On such report, member suspected of being in violation may be **excluded** from community participation for their and the victim's safety until the matter has been resolved. Abuse of this provision, or attempt to circumvent exclusion is grounds for **permanent exclusion** from community activities.

Third party dispute resolution, and recognition of community member feelings are **not a punishment**, and should be viewed as empathy building opportunities.
